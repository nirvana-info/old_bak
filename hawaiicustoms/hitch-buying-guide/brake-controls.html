    <td class="sitewide">Brake controls are designed to apply the brakes of the   towed vehicle (trailer). There are three types of brake controls on the market   today timed, inertia, and proportional. Another type of braking system that is   used for trailers is a breakaway kit.
      <p><strong>Timed Controls</strong><br />
        Timed based controls generate an output signal that   increases over a period of time. The time based controls apply braking power at   the fixed rate that is not proportional to the pressure applied to the brake   pedal. </p>
      <p><strong>Inertia Controls</strong><br />
        Inertia based controls work very much like Timed   based control in that they apply braking power at a preset rate during normal   stopping conditions with one very important difference. Inertia controls have a   patented &quot;Automatic Over-Ride&quot; system with a separate power supply for   unexpected high speed stops. </p>
      <p><strong>Proportional Controls</strong><br />
        Proportional based controls offer a smooth   braking response to almost any stop. Through the use of a sensing device, the   brake control can determine the tow vehicle's rate of deceleration and then   apply the trailer brakes to match. In other words, Proportional controls deliver   power to the trailer brakes in direct relationship to the actual physical   deceleration of the tow vehicle. </p>
      <p><strong>Breakaway Kit</strong><br />
    A breakaway kit is designed to apply to trailer   electric brakes in the event that the trailer becomes disconnected from the   hitch while in motion. This kit is required in many of the States and Provinces. </p></td>
