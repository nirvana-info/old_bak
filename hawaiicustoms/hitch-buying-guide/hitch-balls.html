    <td class="sitewide">The hitch ball mounts to the ball mount or the weight   distributing head. Hitch balls come in different sizes and styles so refer to   &quot;Selecting the correct hitch ball&quot; chart for your specific need. Keep in mind   the hitch ball weight rating should always be equal to or larger than the hitch   and ball mount being used.
      <p><strong>Size Differences</strong> </p>
      <li>1-7/8&quot; balls have ratings up to 2000 lbs with a &frac34;&quot; shank size </li>
      <li>1-7/8&quot; balls have ratings up to 2000 lbs with a 1&quot; shank size </li>
      <li>2&quot; hitch ball has ratings up to 3500 lbs. with a &frac34;&quot; shank size </li>
      <li>2&quot; hitch ball has ratings up to 6000 lbs. with a 1&quot; shank size </li>
      <li>2&quot; hitch ball has ratings up to 8000 lbs. with a 1-1/4&quot; shank size </li>
      <li>2-5/16&quot; hitch ball has ratings up to 6000 with a 1&quot; shank size </li>
      <li>2-5/16&quot; hitch ball has ratings up to 14,000 with a 1-1/4&quot; shank size
        <p><em>Note: The shank size of hitch ball must match the size of the ball mount   shank hole.</em> </p>

    <p>ALWAYS USE THE PROPERLY RATED HITCH BALL FOR YOUR TOWING   SYSTEM.</p>

      <p>Conversely, a 2,000 lb. ball on a 3,500 lb. max trailer weight-rated hitch   decreases your maximum towing capacity to 2,000 lbs. </p>
      <p>The hitch ball diameter (A) must be the same diameter as the trailer coupler   (1-7/8&rdquo;, 2&rdquo;, or 2-5/16&rdquo;). </p>
      <p>The shank diameter (B) of the hitch ball should be the same as the hole   diameter in the (correct) ball mount you selected. </p>
    <p>The shank length (C) should be long enough to allow at least two threads to   be visible when the hitch ball is installed and the nut completely   tightened.</p></td>
