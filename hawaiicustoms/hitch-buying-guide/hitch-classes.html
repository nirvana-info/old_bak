There are five classes of Hitches for   towing trailers. Each class is designed for a specific trailer weight range.   Below you will find a basic description of the trailer hitch classes.When choosing the proper hitch for your needs, make sure the weight rating of the hitch exceeds the loaded weight of the trailer you will be towing. Your towing   vehicle's capacity for weight carrying and hitch attachment will vary and will   may determine the class of hitch that can be used.

        <strong>CLASS I TRAILER HITCH:</strong>&nbsp; <strong><em>2000 pounds GTW, 200 TW*</em></strong>
      
      
        <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class I hitches are weight carrying (WC) hitches rated up   to 2000 lbs. gross trailer weight (GTW) with a maximum trailer tongue weight   (TW) of 200 lbs. The Class I trailer hitch is used to  pull any trailer that is 2000 pounds or less.&nbsp; This trailer hitch is appropriate for most car applications as well as minivans and small SUVs.&nbsp; A Class I  trailer hitch will usually attach to the bumper, truck pan or vehicle frame.&nbsp; Always   consult your owner's manual for vehicle rating. Class I trailer hitches would be used for  such things as a utility trailer for hauling jet skis or other sports  equipment, a utility trailer hauling a lawnmower or lawn and garden equipment,  or a small boat -- basically anything that&rsquo;s under 2000 pounds, that is a  single-axle trailer and does not have tongue weight over 200 pounds. The use of a drawbar and hitch ball of the same rating or   higher is required; a higher class drawbar does not increase the towing capacity of the hitch. A Class I hitch usually has a 1-1/4&quot; square receiver opening.
