    <td class="sitewide">Weight Distribution is used for distributing the   weight of the trailer to the trailer axles and the tow vehicle axles. The   components of a Weight Distributing System is made up of four products. 1). A   Weight Distributing (WD) Hitch which would be attached to the tow vehicle. 2). A   Ball Mount that connects to the Hitch. 3). A Spring Bar Assembly that actually   distribute the weight. 4). A Sway Control device that helps the trailer from   swaying.
      <p><strong>Light-Duty WD </strong><br />
        This unit is designed for light weight use. Hidden   Hitch offers this for both pole tongue and A-frame trailers. </p>
      <ul>
        The Light-Duty Weight-Distributing system is especially designed for use   with lighter weight trailers and pop-up campers. The center mount single bar is   contoured to avoid interference with center mounted jacks. Easy to set up and   use. The lift mechanism is designed to prevent interference with gas bottles or   battery trays. Works with any 2&quot; receiver. A-Frame trailers must have adequate   mounting space for the cross-brace bracket. The cross-brace bracket must be   mounted 18&quot; to 26&quot; rearward of thecenter of the coupler ball receptacle. Make   sure the trailer is clear of any gas bottles, battery trays, or other   obstructions within this area. The integrated lifter bar feature provides the   advantage of allowing a single person to operate from one side of the trailer.   This system works with both side and center mounted tongue jacks. The   swaycontrol platform allows you to use a friction sway control on control   platform allows you to use a friction sway control on either side of the   trailer.

      <p><strong>WD Shanks</strong><br />
        Weight Distributing Shanks are to be used with Round or   Trunnion style weight distributing systems. The shanks come in different lengths   and sizes. </p>
      <p>All Trunnion Weight Distribution Kits require a shank bar sold separately. In   some cases, a longer shank or a deeper drop is required. Hidden Hitch provides a   variety of alternative shank sizes to choose from. </p>

      </ul>
      <p><strong>Sway Control</strong><br />
        There are two popular methods of sway control. The   older, more common form of sway control is a friction device referred to as   FrictionSway Control.<br />
        A more contemporary approach is a device controlled by   cam action. Known as Dual Cam Sway Control, it is an innovative and effective   technique to help control trailer sway before it starts. </p>
      <ul>
        <p>Trailer sway must always be considered in trailer towing. Unwanted sway   turns a pleasant towing situation sour. Many factors can contribute to trailer   sway - the design of the trailer, the suspension, tire inflation pressures,   configuration of the tow vehicle, towing speeds and hitch weight. Therefore,   Hidden Hitch has devised several options to resist or prevent trailer sway.      </p>
        This patented product is the premier method for controlling trailer sway.   Unlike the friction sway control, this approach works to control sway from the   start rather than just resisting sway once it's begun. And it works only when   needed. When towing in a straight line, the cams on either side of the trailers   A-frame are locked in position. This essentially creates a &quot;rigid&quot; connection   between tow vehicle and trailer and minimizes the effects of induced sway caused   by high crosswinds or passing vehicles. Usually the cams ride in a detent,   locked-in position, even on fairly sharp curves. However, when cornering   maneuvers are required, the cams automatically slide out of their detent to   permit full radius turns. Yet when the maneuver is short and abrupt, like that   encountered in the event of a sudden swerve or a wheel dropping off the road,   the cams seek a straight-line towing angle that helps the tow vehicle retain   control. The advantage of the Dual Cam system is its ability toforestall sway in   addition to sway resistance. It works to hold down the start of swaying activity   while at the same time allowing free and easy vehicle and trailer interaction.   Another advantage of the Dual Cam system is that it's installed on the trailer   and therefore doesn't require adjustment every time the towing vehicle and   trailer are hooked up, unless hitch weight or tow vehicle loading are   changed.
        
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Strait-Line</strong><br />
    The Hidden Hitch Strait-Line is a complete Weight   Distribution System that includes the above Trunnion or Round Bar Weight   Distribution kits with the Dual Cam Sway Control and the Shank. </p>
    <p>The Strait-Line Hitch consists of our patented Dual Cam High-Performance Sway   Control and our High-Performance Weight-Distributing System in one   easy-to-install package. This is the ultimate hitch in detail and by design. No   other hitch gives the driver the control this one does at a reasonable price.   The Strait-Line Hitch was given this name as its pro-active design literally   forces the trailer to stay in a straight line behind the tow vehicle. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple installation and adjustment </li>
      <li>Fully automatic and self-centering </li>
      <li>Hooking up spring bars automatically hooks up sway control </li>
