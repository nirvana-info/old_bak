    <td class="sitewide">The ball mount is designed to be inserted into the   hitch. There are different styles of ball mounts, so please refer to &quot;Selecting   the correct ball mount&quot; chart for your specific ball mount. Ball Mounts come in   different lengths and are used in drop and rise positions, use the chart to help   determine which ball mount fits your needs. When selecting a ball mount make   sure to look at the weight rating, it should be equal to or larger than the   hitch being used.
      <p>For safe and comfortable towing the trailer should always be set up to tow on   a level plane. Sometimes a trailer's tongue is higher or lower than the ball   mount on the vehicle. In this situation a ball mount with a &quot;Rise&quot; or a &quot;Drop&quot;   is required to level the trailer.</p>

        <td class="sitewide"><p>Class I &amp; II ball mounts are also referred to as drawbars. The drawbar typically   comes with the hitch because the hitch is designed with a specific drawbar in   mind for each vehicle. Refer to your hitch installation instructions for any   replacement drawbar. </p>
          <p>Class III through V hitches are designed with many different ball mounts in mind   because of the variety of SUV and truck suspensions and tire combinations. </p></td>
