        <td class="sitewide">Trailer accessories are products that mount or secure   to the trailer. Items that are included in this category are safety chains,   couplers, coupler locks, jacks, trailer lights, bearing protectors, and winches.
          <p><strong>Safety Chains</strong><br />
            Safety chains are a safety measure to maintain the   connection between your vehicle and the towed trailer incase of seperation. When   hooking up the Safety Chains to your vehicle, you should always cross the chains   (once) under the connection between your hitch and trailer. The safety chains   should never be dragging on the road when hooked up. Safety Chains come in   different sizes and strengths. Please remember to always use a Safety Chain that   is equal to or stronger than the towing system that is being used. </p>
          <p><strong>Coupler</strong><br />
            A coupler is the connection point mounted on the trailer   which connects the trailer to the vehicle. When replacing a coupler there a few   things that you have to know. First, what is the hitch ball size for the   coupler. Secondly, what type of trailer do you have (Straight Tongue or   A-Frame)? Lastly, what is the Gross Trailer Weight of the Trailer. These are the   basic questions for coupler replacements. Due to the large variety of couplers   on the market, always consult an Authorized Dealer before any repairs. </p>
