    <td class="sitewide">By law, trailer lighting must be connected into the   tow vehicle's wiring system to provide trailer running lights, turn signals and   brake lights. This is accomplished by tapping into the tow vehicle's electrical   harness to transfer power to the trailer wiring system. Connectors are used   between the two to allow disengagement when not towing.
      <p><strong>T-Connectors </strong><br />
        Vehicle-to-trailer light connector is a simple   plug-in solution to connect your vehicle to your trailer. Complete one-piece   wire harness with built in 4-way connector and cover. No cutting or splicing,   OEM appearance, 16 gauge wire. All weather cap included. Light connector   adapters available for 6 &amp; 7-way round connectors. </p>
      <p><strong>Replacement OEM Harnesses</strong><br />
        These products are exact replacements for   damaged OEM wiring harnesses. These can also be used to upgrade vehicles from   4-way OEM wiring to 6 or 7-way connectors or to outfit vehicles that are   equipped with a trailer tow package but no wiring harness for the trailer. </p>
      <p><strong>5th Wheel Harnesses </strong><br />
        Extensions - These heavy duty kits plug into   the 6-Way or 7-Way plugs at the back of the truck and reach 7' into the truck   bed to the fifth wheel wiring. They work with factory 4-Ways and allow easy   hook-up of 5th Wheel and Gooseneck trailers. </p>
      <p><strong>Converter</strong><br />
        Most trailers operate on a two wire system where the   brake lights and turn signals operate on the same wire. When the towing vehicle   has separate wires for brake lights and turn signals, a taillight converter is   required. Converters convert a 3 wire system vehicle to a standard 2 wire   trailer system. Converters draw all the power for the trailer through the   vehicle circuit. </p>
      <p><strong>Power Converter</strong><br />
        Power converters are compatible (if wired   correctly) with either a 2 or 3 wire system. Power converters draw a small   amount of current through the vehicle circuit and do not interfere with the   vehicle system diagnostics. With a power converter, almost all the addition   power required to supply the trailer lights is supplied directly from the   battery, virtually eliminating additional electrical draw on the vehicle's   taillight circuits. The end result: your trailer lights glow brighter! </p>
      <p><strong>4 &amp; 5-Way Connectors</strong><br />
        Choose a connector that has the required   number of pins for the functions required. The male end is mounted on the   vehicle side and the female on the trailer side.<br />
        Flat, molded connectors are   available allowing the basic hookup of the three lighting functions and ground.   Round 1-1/4&quot; knock-out style can be permanently mounted directly onto all Hidden   Hitch products or onto a separate plug mounting bracket. This provides a clean   installation and avoids the potential problems associated with leaving a plug   dangling from the rear of the towing vehicle. </p>
      <p><strong>6 &amp; 7-Way Connectors</strong><br />
        6-Way - Round 1-1/4&quot; diameter metal   connectors are available that allow 1 or 2 additional functions such as back up   lights and electric trailer brake controls. These can be mounted on all Hidden   Hitch products.<br />
        7-Way - Additional pins for auxiliary power, trailer battery   charging etc. are available using larger 2&quot; diameter, round connectors.   Typically these are needed for larger trailers and can be mounted directly in   the bracket mounted on every Class III and IV Hidden Hitch. </p>
      <p><strong>Adapters</strong><br />
        Adapters are used to convert any trailer wiring component,   such as a t-connector or a taillight converter with a 4-Way Flat car end   connector to a 6 or 7-Way round connector allowing you additional pins for   additional trailer functions. </p>
      <p><strong>Mounting Brackets</strong><br />
        Hidden Hitch has a full line of mounting brackets   for professional installation of all electrical wiring plugs without damage to   bumpers or fascia trim. </p>
      <p><strong>Testers</strong><br />
        The Hidden Hitch testers are available as simple in line   circuit testers as well as testers designed into 4-Way or 7-Way trailer ends.   Test everything from turn signals, brake lights &amp; ground wiring to short   circuits in your trailer wiring. </p>
      <p><strong>Wiring Components</strong><br />
    Hidden Hitch carries a full line of large   automotive fuses, OEM style relays, circuit breakers, battery connectors, butt   connectors and wiring to help you with any of your electrical installation   needs. </p></td>
