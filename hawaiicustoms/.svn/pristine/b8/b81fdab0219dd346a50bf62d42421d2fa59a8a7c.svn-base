    <td class="sitewide">Hitch accessories are products that mount to the hitch   or secure the products in the hitch. Items that are included in this category   are pin, clips, locks, anti-rattle devices, tube covers, and front mounted   accessories.
      <p><strong>Pin &amp; Clip</strong><br />
        A pin and clip is used to secure the ball mount to   the hitch. The pin comes in two sizes. A &frac12;&quot; pin is used for Class I &amp; II   hitches, while the 5/8&quot; pin is used for Class III and larger. </p>
      <p><strong>Locks</strong><br />
        A lock can be used instead of a pin &amp; clip. There is a   variety of locks available to choose from. These also come in two sizes similar   to pin and clips (1/2&quot; &amp; 5/8&quot;). </p>
      <p><strong>Tube Covers</strong><br />
        Hidden Hitch recommends that you use a tube cover when   not towing to keep debres from getting in to the hitch opening. There is a   variety of tube cover to choose from. These tube covers are also offered for   Class I through Class V hitches. </p>
      <p><strong>FMR Accessories</strong><br />
    We offer a variety of accessories for your front   mounted receiver. These accessories can also be used in your rear mounted hitch   too. </p></td>
