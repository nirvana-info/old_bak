    <td width="1000"><p>At TruckChamp.com, we LOVE photos of dogs in trucks! But as we gathered photos for this article, we were dismayed to find only ONE photo of a dog properly restrained and safe for traveling. Animal lovers that we are, we're going to assume that the other photos were taken in a parked vehicle, and so no dogs were at risk. As you read our informative article, check out the photos and see if you can guess which photo is &quot;dog-in-motion-safe.&quot; (answer at the bottom) </p>
      <h4><font color="990000">1. Always Use Some Form of Pet Restraint in Your Vehicle</font></h4>
    <p>Everyone loves to see a cute little (or big) dog happy and enjoying the ride. And while 90% of pet owners travel with their pets, fewer than 20% use restraints to protect their pet while in the truck or car. This can mean serious injury to your pet in the event of an accident. According to AAA, a 10 lb. dog in a crash at 50 mph will exert 500 pounds of pressure, and an unrestrained 80 lb. dog in a crash at just 30 mph will exert 2,400 lbs of pressure. </p>
    <p>You should always use a crate, pet carrier, or a doggie seat belt to keep your pet safe, and to keep him from interfering with your driving. Seat belts are great options since they buckle into your vehicle's seat belt, and are a harness that you can easily attach to a leash for rest stops. Plus, you can train your dog to quickly get used to wearing it by having him wear it in the house, while he naps, etc. </p>
    <p>If you have an especially large dog, you may need to have your pet ride in the truck bed, instead of the cab with you. Having your dog secured is especially important the this case. There are pickup truck TieOuts, specially designed for safely transporting your dog in the truck bed. These come with truck bed anchors which hook to the post holes on your truck bed, and have a short lead which connects to the dog's collar. These firm lines keep the dog's head in the center of the truck so he's safely away from the sides and rear. </p></td>

    <td><h4><font color="990000">2. Bring Provisions for the Trip</font></h4>
    <p>If you're going on a lengthy road trip, you'll want to bring food and water dishes for your dog. Travel sizes fit comfortably in medium-to-large crates, or you may prefer to use them at a rest stop. Always have a leash with you for using on stops.  Current tags with your contact information are a must as well. And of course, doggie waste bags for clean-up. During the ride, it's helpful to have a favorite toy and a towel or blanket for your pet to rest comfortably. </p></td>

    <td><h4><font color="990000">3. Don't Allow Your Dog to Hang His Head Out the Window</font></h4>
    <p>Most dogs (but not all!) love the fresh air in their face, and all the aromas of the outdoors. But it's  a foolish risk to take to allow them to hang out the window. Besides the obvious danger of having them jump out of the vehicle, there's other concerns as well. Flying debris, dirt and bugs  can hurt your dog's eyes and cause inner ear and lung infections, according to the ASPCA. </p></td>

    <td><h4><font color="990000">4. Never Leave Your Dog in the Vehicle Alone </font></h4>
    <p>You should plan accordingly so your pet never has to stay in the truck without you. In the summer, temperatures inside a vehicle can reach 120 degrees in just minutes on a hot day. Likewise it gets cold very quickly in the winter time. If you absolutely have to leave your pet for a short time- if it's summer, be sure to open the window partially to allow for some ventilation. </p></td>

    <td><h4><font color="990000">5. Prepare Your Dog For Road Trips</font></h4>
    <p>You want to be sure your pet is acclimated to riding in the truck or car before taking long trips, or even just running errands around town. It's always easiest to train a dog when you can start them young, but you may not always have that option. Crate training is a big part of it, and there's actually videos on You Tube helping you with tips to do that. A doggie seat belt is probably the easier choice, and you can let your dog wear it other times to get used to it. Before making your first outing, you may want to simply have your pet sit in the vehicle, while it's parked, on a gradually time-increasing schedule. When you're ready to take to the road, start with short trips and gradually go for longer periods of time. </p></td>
